# Directory where all data is stored, e.g. queue, accounts and messages, ACME TLS
# certs/keys. If this is a relative path, it is relative to the directory of
# mox.conf.
DataDir: ../data

# Default log level, one of: error, info, debug, trace, traceauth, tracedata.
# Trace logs SMTP and IMAP protocol transcripts, with traceauth also messages with
# passwords, and tracedata on top of that also the full data exchanges (full
# messages), which can be a large amount of data.
LogLevel: debug

# User to switch to after binding to all sockets as root. Default: mox. If the
# value is not a known user, it is parsed as integer and used as uid and gid.
# (optional)
User: mox

# Full hostname of system, e.g. mail.<domain>
Hostname: upper.town

# If enabled, a single DNS TXT lookup of _updates.xmox.nl is done every 24h to
# check for a new release. Each time a new release is found, a changelog is

# mailbox. (optional)

# RECOMMENDED: please enable to stay up to date

# Listeners are groups of IP addresses and services enabled on those IP addresses,
# such as SMTP/IMAP or internal endpoints for administration or Prometheus
# metrics. All listeners with SMTP/IMAP services enabled will serve all configured
# domains. If the listener is named 'public', it will get a few helpful additional
# configuration checks, for acme automatic tls certificates and monitoring of ips
# in dnsbls if those are configured.
Listeners:
	internal:

		# Use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all IPv4 and/or :: to listen on all IPv6 addresses, but
		# it is better to explicitly specify the IPs you want to use for email, as mox
		# will make sure outgoing connections will only be made from one of those IPs. If
		# both outgoing IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity is possible, and only one family has
		# explicitly configured addresses, both address families are still used for
		# outgoing connections. Use the "direct" transport to limit address families for
		# outgoing connections.
		IPs:
			- 127.0.0.1

		# If empty, the config global Hostname is used. The internal services webadmin,
		# webaccount, webmail and webapi only match requests to IPs, this hostname,
		# "localhost". All except webadmin also match for any client settings domain.
		# (optional)
		Hostname: localhost

		# Account web interface, for email users wanting to change their accounts, e.g.
		# set new password, set new delivery rulesets. Default path is /. (optional)

			# limiting and for the "secure" status of cookies. (optional)
			Forwarded: true

		# Admin web interface, for managing domains, accounts, etc. Default path is
		# /admin/. Preferably only enable on non-public IPs. Hint: use 'ssh -L
		# 8080:localhost:80 you@yourmachine' and open http://localhost:8080/admin/, or set
		# up a tunnel (e.g. WireGuard) and add its IP to the mox 'internal' listener.

		# Serve autoconfiguration/autodiscovery to simplify configuring email

		AutoconfigHTTPS:
			Enabled: true

			# TLS port, 443 by default. You should only override this if you cannot listen on

			# port forwarding. (optional)
			Port: 1080

			# If set, plain HTTP instead of HTTPS is spoken on the configured port. Can be

		# Serve MTA-STS policies describing SMTP TLS requirements. Requires a TLS config.
		# (optional)

			Enabled: true

			# TLS port, 443 by default. You should only override this if you cannot listen on

		IPs:
			- 137.184.13.246

		# If set, the mail server is configured behind a NAT and field IPs are internal

		# (optional)
		SMTP:
			Enabled: true

			# Addresses of DNS block lists for incoming messages. Block lists are only
			# consulted for connections/messages without enough reputation to make an
			# accept/reject decision. This prevents sending IPs of all communications to the
			# block list provider. If any of the listed DNSBLs contains a requested IP
			# address, the message is rejected as spam. The DNSBLs are checked for healthiness
			# before use, at most once per 4 hours. IPs we can send from are periodically
			# checked for being in the configured DNSBLs. See MonitorDNSBLs in domains.conf to
			# only monitor IPs we send from, without using those DNSBLs for incoming messages.
			# Example DNSBLs: sbl.spamhaus.org, bl.spamcop.net. See
			# https://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/ and https://www.spamcop.net/ for more information
			# and terms of use. (optional)

# Destination for emails delivered to postmaster addresses: a plain 'postmaster'

# enabled), and as fallback for each domain without explicitly configured
# postmaster destination.
Postmaster:
	Account: postmaster

	# E.g. Postmaster or Inbox.
	Mailbox: Postmaster

# Destination for per-host TLS reports (TLSRPT). TLS reports can be per recipient
# domain (for MTA-STS), or per MX host (for DANE). The per-domain TLS reporting
# configuration is in domains.conf. This is the TLS reporting configuration for
# this host. If absent, no host-based TLSRPT address is configured, and no host
# TLSRPT DNS record is suggested. (optional)
HostTLSRPT:

	# Account to deliver TLS reports to. Typically same account as for postmaster.
	Account: postmaster

	# Mailbox to deliver TLS reports to. Recommended value: TLSRPT.
	Mailbox: TLSRPT

	# Localpart at hostname to accept TLS reports at. Recommended value: tlsreports.
